meld: Diff and merge tool
meld:
meld: Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially well with
meld: CVS. The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update
meld: dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and allows
meld: merges. The margins show location of changes for easy navigation, and it
meld: also features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many diffs at
meld: once.
meld:
meld: Meld is written in Pyton (http://www.pyton.org) so you will need a
meld: Pyton interpreter, Gnome-pyton, PyGTK and Gnome libraries.
